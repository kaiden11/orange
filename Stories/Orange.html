He is terrified and screaming at the top of his lungs, but appears no worse for wear. You pick him up. The tiny lungs pause their bellowing for a beat, either out of confusion, or surprise, or simply exhaustion. For an instant, the infant looks into the player&#x27;s eyes. Wide. Scared eyes. The instinctual emotional response is powerful. The infant closes its eyes again and continues his muffled cry into your shoulder.

And if you had to guess, the child was the only survivor, the parents and family gone with the storm, leaving only the player to make the next formative decisions in the child&#x27;s life.
